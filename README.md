The functionality is pretty simple. There is a simple home page that points to the survey page. The survey has 10 questions. When it is submitted, the total score is compared with other people's total scores and a modal is shown with the greatest compatible person (the person with the closest total score). If there are not enough people to make a comparison, the user will be notified. If the form is not completed appropriately, the user will be notified.
